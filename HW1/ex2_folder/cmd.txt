output:
**this article has been encoded in leet.**

if you can read this, you probably have seen this form of writing before. in case you haven't, this is a common way of disguising text by replacing letters with numbers.

However, the idea behind this article is to see if it can be **unleeted** back to a readable form. if the reverse process does not reveal a compietely coherent english sentence, there may be an error in the leet conversion.

if you've decoded this article and it is completely readable, then the leet translation is correct. otherwise, something went wrong.

Good luck unleeting this!
